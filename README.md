# Online Product Purchase - Basic Version

This is my very own Python project based on basic concepts of:
- if-else
- loops
- lists
- try-except handling

Here I created a simple console-based product purchase system where:
- Customers can place orders
- Cancel orders
- Give ratings to products

This is my starting version â€” I will keep improving this with time!

Appreciate feedback & suggestions.
